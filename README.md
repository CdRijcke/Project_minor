<h3>Obesity</h3>
Growing in size


With each year, the mean BMI of the world rises, going beyond health limits. To create an overview on this BMI increase, a map has been created, showing the mean BMI per country for a selected year.

Additional information on the fraction of the population that is obese is shown in a barchart for every country. Next to it, a scatterplot shows the relation between mean BMI and BMI related subjects, food supply, physical activity and the fraction overweight and obese.

With the slider, a year can be selected, and on hover countries and cata can be highlighted.
Dropdown menus serve to select different categories for the several visualizaion, optimizing a gain of insight into BMI and its magnitude.

Have fun exploring our huge world,


Chris
