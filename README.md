Obesity
Growing in size


With each year, the mean BMI of the world rises, going beyond health limits. To create an overview on this BMI increase, a map has been created, showing the mean BMI per country for a selected year.

Additional information on the fraction of the population that is obese is shown in a barchart for every country. Next to it, a scatterplot shows the relation between mean BMI and BMI related subjects, food supply, physical activity and the fraction overweight and obese.

(line graph of years vs average BMI of the world population, not necessary for MVP)

More countries with a higher BMI.


(infomap of obesity with a slider that sets the year, next to it a barchart can be added,making use of the same slider to represent the same data in a more overviewable form, the bars represent countries are in a certain BMI range)


General idea of gaining weight is simple: consume more energy than you use.

(scatterplot: obesity vs either physical activity or calorie intake per country, which can be switch between by the use of a button)

Awereness of physical activity and calorie intake should be spread to fight obesity



To create the visualization, an infomap has to be downloaded and bar graphs have to be created. Data has to be retrieved on obesity (BMI), physical activity, calorie intake, all per country and an average value per capita. 
Obesity and physical activity data is retrievable from the World Health Organization site.
Food consumption is retrieved from the Food and Agricultural Organization site.

Probably Problematic: 
- linking up the slider to the graph and the barchart. 
- a switch button for the scatterplot
- getting everything done in time
