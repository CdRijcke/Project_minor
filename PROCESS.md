For today I’ll be writing my project proposal and to avoid any more delay, first focus on finding some good data before I work out the story.

17 January 2017,

The project proposal has been filed. Next up is to work on the design document. From this I assume I have to make a rough setup in html to make something that already kind of looks like a webpage.

Met with my stand-up group today. Briefly discussed everyones topic and received feedback on my idea. Best tips were: 
- Make sure your data comes in the right format for every visualisation you are going to use
- Write down decision I am making during the design of my project
- Make sure every visualization is linked to at least one other visualization

From this site I found a table containing mean BMI for the separate sexes and obesity percentage:

From this site I found a table containing mean Food supply in Kcal per capita per day:
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/per_capita_food_supply

At the start of the day I have decided to not link my scatterplot to the slider due to insufficient datasets. Instead it will be linked to the world map, highlighting the country that is selected in the map to show the food supply per capita per day and prevalence of insufficient physical activity among adults in the scatterplot. 
What remains is what exact data I’ll be using since I have the choice to display the sexes or a mean of them. Since the data for man and women is significantly different and I have both data sets available. I will create the datasets in such a fashion that for every visualisation a men and women option is available. 
Set-up for the data:

[{year:	{sex:		{country:		{mean MBI: 23.0 , fraction_obese: 0.03

Started yesterday with finishing the JSON file that can be used to extract data from. The plan for the week is to get to an alpha in which all the visualizations are finished and to a certain height the interactions, I’d like the individual interactions to be finished but not the linked interactions. 
For now the data map is done, which leaves me to the barplot and scatterplot. Since my previous experience with these plots were not so good, I aim to utilize the help from the assistants as much as possible. 

25 January 2017,

Finished the drawing of the barplot and scatterplot

26 January 2017,

Added interactivity to the barplot that is linked to the datamap

27 Janurary 2017,

Added interactivity to the scatterplot and linked the visualizations together

30 January 2017,

Edited the colours in the barchart and scatterplot and added a barchart sort checkbox

31 January 2017,

Started with the report, fixed some buggs, one of which the barchart and scatterplot didn’t return to their original colour after being highlighted
